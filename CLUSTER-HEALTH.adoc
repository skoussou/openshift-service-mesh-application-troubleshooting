|Cause
|Troubleshoot Focus Areas
|How to Troubleshoot

|*Cause 1: Cluster Health related*
|
|

|Cluster cannot offer resources CPU/RAM/Persistence required by the POD 
| a) Cluster state
| 
- link:[Cluster Events]

- link:[Cluster Router]

- link:[Registry]

|
| b) Cluster resources state
| - link:[CPU & RAM Nodes Inspection]

|
| c) Worker Nodes Failing/Stopped/Missing
| - link:[Machine Configs & State]

|
| d) Persistence Layer Failures 
| 
- link:[Check PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim State]

- link:[Persistence StorageClass ]

|*Cause 2: Cluster Config related*
|
|

| POD # or Deployment CPU/RAM resource request/limits beyond allowed limits
| a) Resource Quotas (resource `ResourceQuota`)
| - link:[Check if ResourceQuota applied on namespace]

|
| b) Resource `LimitRange`
| - link:[Check if LimitRange have been applied]

| Networking failures/misalignments
| a) Failed to pull required images from registry
| - link:[Cluster Events]

| 
| b) Failed to connect to services on other worker nodes
| - link:[Check Node Calling/Called PODs Deployed and if CLUSTER n/w connectivity is available]

| `PestistentVolume` and/or `StorageClass` Config Issues
| a) PVs not bounding due to Persistence Layer issue
| 
- link:[Check PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim State]

- link:[Cluster Events]

|
| b) PVs not finding StorgeClass 
| - link:[Check PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim State]

| 
| c) No storage left
| Check with OCP monitoring team on Storage state

- link:[For single POD check PV storage]



|*Cause 3: Application or Application Environment related*
|
|

| Dependent Services unavailable
| a) Have not been instantiated
| - link:[Check the deployments of dependent services have at least 1 POD running (in SM check via KIALI)]

|
| b) Networking access is not available 
| 
- link:[Check Node Calling/Called PODs Deployed and if CLUSTER n/w connectivity is available]

- link:[Check if POD part of the Service Mesh]

| Containerized application fails
| a) Problem with the containerized application
| 
- link:[How do I debug an application that fails to start up?]

- link:[Check Application Logs for application errors]

- link:[Check POD Events to ensure images downloaded successfully]

- link:[Check Registry to ensure images can be downloaded]

| Labelling, Scheduling, Taints & Toleration Misalignments
| a) Scheduling with Affinity/Anti-Affinity
| 
- link:[Checking placement of POD based on Affinity and Anti-Affinity Rules]

- link:[Checking placement of POD based on nodes using node affinity rules]

|
| b) Selectors
| - link:[Selectors Validation to ensure OCP configs are as expected]

|
| c) Node Selectors
| - link:[Check existence/matching of POD to Node defined selectors]

|
| d) Taints/Tolerations
| - link:[Check POD Defined Tolerations and Node defined Taints]

|*Cause 4: Deployment Related*
|
|

| Failed Readiness/Liveness Healthchecks
| a) `Deployment`/`DeploymentConfig` Resource POD replicas `Not Equal` to started PODs
| - link:[Check if the # of Deployed PODs is correct]

| 
| b) Events showing Health Checks failures and/or timeouts
| - link:[Check POD Events]

| 
| c) Restarts of the POD
| - link:[Check POD Restarts for indication of errors]

| Erroneous Deployment configs
| a) Failing init-containers
| 
- link:[Check POD Events]

- link:[Check Application Logs]

|
| b) Expected image not available in registry, repository
| - link:[Check POD & Cluster Events to ensure availability]

|
| c) Expected image or registry not reachable (network, security)
| - link:[Check POD & Cluster Events]

|
| d) Erroneous Environment Variable Configurations 
| This is not easily identifiable other than by

- link:[Check for errors in Application Logs]

- Check expected environment variables based on application documentation

| PesistenceVolume/StorageClass Issues
| a) StorageClass does not offer auto creation of PesistenceVolume
| 
- link:[Check PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim State]

- link:[Persistence StorageClass]

|
| b) StorageClass does not offer characteristics required by Deployment (ReadWriteMany etc.)
| - link:[Persistence StorageClass ]
