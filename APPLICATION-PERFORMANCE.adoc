|Troubleshoot Focus Areas
|How to Troubleshoot

|*Cause 1: Failed Connections*
|
|

|Mutual TLS failures
| a) Client/Service Mesh certificates configurations (Service Mesh `Gateway`)
| - link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#service-mesh-certificates[Check Service Mesh Certificates and Service Mesh Configs]

|
| b) Service Mesh `ServiceEntry` certificates configuration
| - link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#service-mesh-certificates[Check Service Mesh Certificates and Service Mesh Configs]

|Authorisation failures

|Network issues
| a) Calling service is deployed in an OCP worker node or a different OCP cluster which does not have access to the node/cluster where the called service POD is deployed
| - link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#pod-deployment-location[Check Node Calling/Called PODs Deployed and if CLUSTER n/w connectivity is available]

| 
| b) Calling service is not in service mesh but called service is in the Service Mesh continuously restarts]
|
- link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#pod-is-in-the-service-mesh[Check PODs are in the same Service Mesh]

- link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#service-mesh-certificates[Check if service mesh configuration allows calls to external services]

|
| c) Calling service is part of a different Service Mesh than called service  
| - link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#pod-is-in-the-service-mesh[Check PODs are in the same Service Mesh by comparing namespaces in the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`]

|
| d) Service Mesh configuration of `Gateway` for that service does not exist or does not expose the service correctly (hostname etc.)
| - link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#service-mesh-certificates[Check Service Mesh Network Configurations allow access to services]

|
| e) OCP Route to service does not exist
| - link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#service-mesh-certificates[Check Service Mesh Network Configurations allow access to services]

|
| f) Service Mesh envoy have the correct/up-to-date configurations
|

|*Cause 2: Slow Responses*
|
|

|POD/Deployment resource configuration limits reached
| a) CPU/RAM/Network/Persistence POD Limits
| - link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#pod-resources-usage[Check POD Containers Resources Usage]

|POD numbers < replicas defined in Deployment
| a) Deployment State
| - link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#anchor-5[POD Replicas Desired/Created]

|
| b) Resource Limits
|

- link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#check-resource-quotas-limit-ranges[Check if LimitRange have been applied affecting deployment]

|Restarting PODs
| a) POD Restarts
|

- link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#cluster-events[Check POD & Cluster Events]


|Application Configurations
| a) Application Logging level
| 
- link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#application-logs[Check if Application Logging Levels are too high] (INFO normal, DEBUG/TRACE too high for all containers)

|
| b) Backed up requests towards failing/slow service

- link:https://github.com/skoussou/openshift-service-mesh-application-troubleshooting/blob/main/TROUBLESHOOTING-ACTIONS.adoc#service-mesh-observability[Validate Configurations/Errors with Service Mesh Observability]


|
| c) Retries towards failing/slow service
