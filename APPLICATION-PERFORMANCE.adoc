|How to Troubleshoot

|*Cause 1: Failed Connections*
|
|

|Mutual TLS failures
| a) Client/Service Mesh certificates configurations (Service Mesh GateWay)
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

|
| b) Service Mesh ServiceEntry certificates configuration
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

|Authorisation failures
|
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

|Network issues
| a) Calling service is deployed in an OCP worker node or OCP cluster which does not have access to the node/cluster where the called service POD is deployed
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

| 
| b) Calling service is not in service mesh but called service is in the Service Mesh continuously restarts]
|
- link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or] 

- link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

|
| c) Calling service is part of a different Service Mesh than called service  
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts] 

|
| d) Service Mesh configuration of GateWay for that service does not exist or does not expose the service correctly (hostname etc.)
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

|
| e) OCP Route to service does not exist
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

|
| f) Service Mesh envoy have the correct/up-to-date configurations
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

|*Cause 2: Slow Responses*
|
|

|POD/Deployment resource configuration limits reached
| a) CPU/RAM/Network/Persistence POD Limits
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

|POD numbers < replicas defined in Deployment
| a) Deployment State
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts

|
| b) Resource Limits
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts]

|Restarting PODs
| a) POD Restarts
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restar

|Application Configurations
| a) Application Logging level
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restar

|
| b) Backed up requests towards failing/slow service
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts

|
| c) Retries towards failing/slow service
| - link:./CLUSTER-HEALTH.adoc[Application POD does not start or continuously restarts
